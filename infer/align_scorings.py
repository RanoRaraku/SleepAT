Align ref and hyp for evaluation.

def align_scorings(ref:list, hyp:list) -> list:
    """
    Aligns 'ref' and 'hyp' for an utterance. The inputs are lists of scored & predicted
    events, each event being a dict() with boundary marks. Lists can't be empty, events
    need to be continuous, meaning end of event_[n] equals beg. of event_[n+1], and the
    events span the same time-frame. The alignemnt metric is the area-of-overlap (AoO),
    computed as (2*t_overlap / t_ref+t_hyp), 't' being duration. Events are aligned using
    dynamic programming to find optimal event pairs, meaning AoO is maximized. The return
    is a list of dicts containing {ref_id, hyp_id, AoO value), where 'id' is the index.
    The alignemnt can be used with ref & hyp only, as events are only referenced.

    Arguments:
        ref ... ref scoring as list of events(dicts)
        hyp ... hyp scoring as a list of events(dicts)
    Return:
        ali ...list of dicts with in form of (ref_id, hyp_id, AoO value)
