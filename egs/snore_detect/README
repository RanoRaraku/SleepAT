Part of dataset was manually scored by Marta Sewartko specifically for this purpose.
The subsets "train_set" and "test_set" are given and core for supervised training.
The remaining subjects can be used for semi-supervised training as we have no realiable
labels for them. Things are stored in numpy arrays and json formats to ensure
compatibility and possibility to use other toolkits other than pyTorch.
