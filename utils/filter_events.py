    Filter the annotation for events that have a value for a 'key' in a list of 'valid_values'.
    Annotation is a list of events, where each event is a dictionary. The standard form for an
    event is {'label', 'onset', 'duration'}, but it can contain more 'keys'. Look at
    make_annotation() for reference. However, the routine allows to search for a general 'key'
    with a valid value.
    Input:
        events .... a list of events where each event is a dictionary
        key .... which key in the event should match the valid values (default:str = '')
        valid_values .... can be a string or a list (default:str = '')
