    Segment list of events, where each event is a dictionary, according to
    the segmentation dict, events can be split into multiple segments.
    Assumptions about segments and events:
    1) Events and segments are chornologically ordered by their onsets,
    2) They use the same units (i.e. seconds or samples).
    3) There is no overlap between events.

    The function is a generator, the accumulation happens on the consumer part.
    Input:
        events .... a list of events, each event is a dictionary (default:list).
        segments .... a dict of segments, each segment is a dictionary (default:dict).
    Output:
        a tuple of (seg_id, seg_events).
