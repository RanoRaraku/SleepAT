    Write content into a json file. The content is a dictionary where the 'key' is utt_id.
    Indexing by utt_id allows to match contents between multiple json_files. This is used
    to create audio.scp, feats.scp and target.scp and many others. Content cannot contain
    duplicate values so utt_id have to be unique .
    Audio.scp maps between utt_id and audio files used to extract the features.
    Feats.scp maps between utt_id and files that contain extracted features.
    Segments maps between utt_it and segments that will be cut out prior to feature extraction.
    Annotation maps between utt_id and all scored events used to crate target.scp.
    Target.scp maps between utt_it and files that contain targets for each feature file.
    Input:
        file .... path to the output file
        content .... a dictionary of the format dict[utt_id] = value (default:dict = None)
