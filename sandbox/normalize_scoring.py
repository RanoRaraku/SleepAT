    """
    Normalize scoring for evalution by adding null events, merging events with identical
    numerical labels, and normalizing text labels. A scoring is a list of events, each is
    dict(), that occur within an utterance, which can be also empty. Full info on the 
    utterance bounds is saved in 'period'. Scoring duration is the length of that utterance
    and it must use same units as event['onset'] and event['duration']. Scoring_start is used
    to anchor events in date-time to adher to annotation file format.
    1) Add 'null' events to fill in gaps between events.
    2) Normalize text labels to eliminates ambiguous labels.
    3) Merge identical events to eliminate sequences (i.e 000->0).

    Arguments:
        scoring ... a list of events inside an utterance
        period ... info on utterance start, onset and duration
        events ... mapping between numerical and text labels of events
    Return:
        normalized scoring

    Todo:
        load 'null' label from a file instead of hardcoding is to 'null'
